## Dotfile Management
* To edit a dotfile (e.g. .zshrc):
  1. Check if the file is being managed by chezmoi
  2. If it is not being managed, add it to chezmoi
  3. If it is being managed, edit the file in chezmoi
  4. Once editing is complete, prompt the user to apply the chezmoi changes
* zsh aliases are managed by chezmoi in ~/.local/share/chezmoi/home/dot_zsh_aliases.tmpl

## Github CLI (`gh`) tips
`gh` only supports adding a comment to a pull request (https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_comment).  If asked to create, update, delete or reply to a PR review comment, prefer using `gh api` (https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_api) and the REST API for review commments (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/comments?apiVersion=2022-11-28#about-pull-request-review-comments)
